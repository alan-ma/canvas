# canvas
Playing with HTML5's canvas element.<br>
First project: <a href="https://alan-ma.github.io/canvas/colours.html" target="_blank">colours</a><br>
I wanted to do something that tracked mouse movements, then added dynamic circle sizes and random colours.<br>
<br>
Second project: <a href="https://alan-ma.github.io/canvas/snow.html" target="_blank">snow</a><br>
It started with a train of circles; I found a nice picture of a snowglobe (from Unsplash) and decided to add snow.<br>
<br>
Third project: unknown
