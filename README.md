# canvas
Playing with HTML5's canvas element.<br>
First project: <a href="https://alan-ma.github.io/canvas/colours" target="_blank">colours</a><br>
I wanted to do something that tracked mouse movements, then added dynamic circle sizes and random colours.<br>
<br>
Second project: <a href="https://alan-ma.github.io/canvas/snow" target="_blank">snow</a><br>
It started with a train of circles; I found a nice picture of a snowglobe (from Unsplash) and decided to add snow.<br>
<br>
Third project: <a href="https://alan-ma.github.io/canvas/ball" target="_blank">ball</a><br>
Move a ball around while seeing its velocities. The controls should be pretty smooth. Originally intended to be a platformer but I'll leave it as a simple version.<br>
<br>
Fourth project: <a href="https://alan-ma.github.io/lomansearch" target="_blank">loman search</a><br>
Created for my English class. Move around trying to find your goals in the pitch dark world.<br>
<br>
Fifth project: <a href="https://alan-ma.github.io/snake" target="_blank">snake</a><br>
I saw Chris DeLeon's video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGmXxpIj6vs" target="_blank">here</a> and thought that it was brilliant. I essentially copied/rewrote all of the code to get more familiar with it.<br>
<br>
Sixth project: undecided
