# canvas
Playing with HTML5's canvas element.<br>
First project: colours<br>
I wanted to do something that tracked mouse movements, then added dynamic circle sizes and random colours.<br>
<br>
Second project: snow<br>
It started with a train of circles; I found a nice picture of a snowglobe (from Unsplash) and decided to add snow.<br>

Third project: unknown
